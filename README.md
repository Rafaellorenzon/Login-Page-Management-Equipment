Equipment Management System, based in a warehouse, on this website written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript you can manage users, locations and equipment. There are two types of administrator and user profiles, the user can select equipment and locations that will be used and where he will use it, going through a mandatory list to check if the equipment is in working order, and can also report damage to equipment leaving - unavailable for use. Admin: will have complete access to users, being able to create, modify and have full control over users, with data times and histories of when changes or actions were made to users, equipment and locations.

I spent 6 months learning how to build this idea from scratch without any knowledge, today I make it available on my github as a way to show that I am capable of creating solutions for companies.
